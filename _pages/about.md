Hi, this is the personal website for Michael T. Bacon.

I am currently employed as a Research Developer at the [Renaissance
Computing Institute (RENCI)](https://renci.org) at UNC Chapel Hill.

In 2021 I completed my Ph.D. in the Constructed Environment at the
University of Virginia School of Architecture.

My personal academic research focuses on the community land buyout
movement in rural Scotland, and trying to sort out how community land
ownership seems to reverse economic and demographic decline while
simultaneously improving environmental conditions. Other work I'm
currently doing involves investigating the intersection of science,
technology, and society (STS) work and planning theory. The full text
of [my dissertation is available
online](https://libraetd.lib.virginia.edu/public_view/j3860780s).
