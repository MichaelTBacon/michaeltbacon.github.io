Hi, this is the personal website for Michael T. Bacon, Ph.D. student in the
Constructed Environment at the University of Virginia School of Architecture.

My dissertation focuses on the community land buyout movement in rural
Scotland, and trying to sort out how community land ownership seems to reverse
economic and demographic decline while simultaneously improving environmental
conditions. Other work I'm currently doing involves investigating the
intersection of science, technology, and society (STS) work and planning
theory.

More here as time permits, as usual.
