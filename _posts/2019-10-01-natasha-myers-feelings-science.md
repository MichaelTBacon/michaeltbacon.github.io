As much as I complain about Twitter (and as I finally, after years, get a
better hang of the site I do it less), it brings me some wonderful stuff,
particularly along academic and activist lines. The following came across my
feed a week or so ago about teaching a course in STS.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I finally got the ok
to teach this intro to STS course this Fall, so I’m going to be slapping
together the syllabus in like a week if anyone has any advice or examples to
share!</p>&mdash; Chad J. Valasek (@chadjvalasek) <a

Now I'm trying to label myself as having some at least moderate academic
expertise in STS, so when another of my follows, @allergyPhD, replied with the
following, I dug into the syllabus she posted.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">u love 2 see it <a

Much of the content I was already familiar with (WHEW!) but a couple sources
caught my eye and I decided to follow up and read them. The one which most
caught my attention was [this paper from Natasha Myers on "plant
feelings."](https://www.academia.edu/16543355/Conversations_on_Plant_Sensing_Notes_from_the_field)

The paper is worth a read on its own merits, and I can particularly recommend
its approachable style and language. Notably, Myers gets into, on the one
hand, the ways in which plants sense their environment and respond to it, and
on the other hand, the ways win which botanists and ecologists who study those
plants talk discuss these subjects in terms of "plant feelings," and how
anthropomorphic language plays into those conversations.

Myers' initial forays into these conversations, as she documents in the
opening pages, are met with suspicion and hostility at first. At first read,
this appears to be a kind of defensiveness of internal scientific language and
a desire to not be judged for being silly scientists, or perhaps a bit of
hypocrisy, dismissing anthropomorphic language in non-scientists while
practicing it themselves.

What Myers uncovers, in a credit to her generous and careful ear, is something
quite different. As Myers notes,

> She taught me how hard it is for these researchers to speak about their work
> on plant sensing without stumbling into what they saw as the ‘trap’ of
> anthropomorphism at every turn. This conversation tuned me in to what it was
> that these researchers wanted me to hear them saying, and what—in spite of
> what they actually said—they did not want me to hear them saying. In this
> process I also had to confront what it was that I wanted to hear them say,
> and what I wanted to make their research mean. Moreover, these conversations
> helped me see that anthropomorphism is not always a trap; rather, in
> Isabelle Stengers’ (2008) sense of the term, anthropomorphism can, in the
> right hands, also be a ‘lure’, one that ‘vectorizes’ research attentions,
> inspires new questions, and propels inquiry. (Myers 2015, 39-40)

To do the article full justice in summary would make this blog post far longer
than it needs to be, so I'll just note a few high points here.

Much of the work I do that touches on STS subjects gets to the notion of
non-human agency, as expressed in actor-network theory, as well as affective
ties. Myers' touch here deftly demonstrates the power of looking for both of
these. The following paragraph highlights how examining the relationship of
the scientist to her subject matter, with neither an attempt to force the
relationship into that of a hyper-rational structure nor to judge it as
falling short of a scientific ideal, illustrates how complex and contextual
the process of strong knowledge creation can be.

> exploring how far they were willing to go with their stories of the
> ‘uncanny’, ‘amazing’, and ‘crazy’ things plants can do. Conversations with

Anthropomorphism as expressed by the scientists, then, is not an imputing of
human emotions onto non-human actors. Rather, it is the hard, mind-bending,
emotive work of understanding the agency and experiences of the plants through
the best lenses the human mind has to offer, entering into deep emotional
bonds with some plants. Further, as Myers notes, the scientists repeatedly
insist that a less trained, more naive anthropomorphism is inappropriate not
because plants don't have "feelings" of a sort, but rather because it is
wholly inappropriately human-centered to simply impute the human experience
onto plants, because it privileges the human experience of feeling over the,
in the scientists' view, equally valid plant-centric experience of feelings.
